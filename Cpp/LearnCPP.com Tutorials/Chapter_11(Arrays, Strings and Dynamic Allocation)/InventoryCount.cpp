/*Pretend youâ€™re writing a game where the player can hold 3 types of items: health potions, torches, and arrows. Create an enum to identify the different types of items, and a std::array to store the number of each item the player is carrying (the enumerators are used as indexes of the array). The player should start with 2 health potions, 5 torches, and 10 arrows. Write a function called countTotalItems() that returns how many items the player has in total. Have your main() function print the output of countTotalItems() as well as the number of torches.*/
